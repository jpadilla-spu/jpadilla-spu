### Howdy ðŸ‘‹

I'm Julie Padilla (she/her) and Iâ€™m currently a Water Planner in the Water Planning Unit at Seattle Public Utilities. What that means in practice is that one chunk of my time is devoted to realtime reservoir management for the City's reservoirs on the [Cedar River](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/12115900/#parameterCode=00065&period=P7D&showMedian=false) and the [South Fork Tolt River](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/12147900/#parameterCode=62614&period=P30D&showMedian=true). When I'm on working on realtime, I am working on long-term planning projects related to reservoir management and drinking water supply.

Data science techniques are a key part of how I get the above work done. Right now I am working on two suites of automation tools: one aimed at speeding up the Water Planning Unit's (WPU's) regular reporting activities. The other suite of tools is intended to help improve reporting and data viz for WPU's primary watershed model, HFAM
