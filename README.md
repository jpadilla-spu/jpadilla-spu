I'm Julie Padilla (she/her) and Iâ€™m currently a Water Planner in the Water Planning Unit at Seattle Public Utilities. 

Right now I am working on two suites of automation tools: one aimed at speeding up the Water Planning Unit's (WPU's) regular reporting activities. The other suite of tools is intended to help improve reporting and data viz for WPU's primary watershed model, HFAM
